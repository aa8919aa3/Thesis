   - Check logical flow and coherence

2. **Technical Content Analysis**
   - Verify physics concepts and theoretical frameworks
   - Assess mathematical derivations and formulations
   - Evaluate experimental methodology
   - Check data analysis and interpretation

3. **Academic Writing Standards**
   - Review clarity and precision of scientific language
   - Assess proper use of technical terminology
   - Evaluate citation quality and literature integration
   - Check figure/table quality and relevance

4. **Constructive Feedback Structure**
   - **Observation**: Describe what was found
   - **Impact**: Explain why it matters
   - **Suggestion**: Provide specific improvement recommendations
   - **Priority**: Classify as High/Medium/Low priority

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Review all chapters in a directory
python3 physics_professor_reviewer.py chapters/

# Review a single chapter file
python3 physics_professor_reviewer.py chapters/Ch1-introduction.typ
```

### Output Format

The system generates a comprehensive review in Markdown format with:

- **Overall Assessment** for each chapter
- **Strengths** identified in the work
- **Areas for Improvement** with categorized feedback
- **Specific Line-by-Line Comments** for detailed issues
- **Recommended Resources** for addressing identified problems

## Example Review Output

```markdown
### Chapter 1: Introduction
**Overall Assessment**: This chapter shows excellent development of introduction content with approximately 350 words. The technical treatment is appropriate for a master's level thesis, though some areas require attention to meet publication standards.

**Strengths**:
- Excellent bilingual presentation enhancing international accessibility
- Strong technical vocabulary and physics terminology usage
- Well-structured chapter organization with clear subsections

**Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Theoretical Framework**
   - Issue: Current-phase relation discussion lacks mathematical formulation
   - Suggestion: Include explicit mathematical expressions for CPR, starting with the basic sinusoidal form I_s = I_c sin(œÜ)
   - Priority: High

**Recommended Resources**:
- Clarke, J. & Braginski, A.I. (2004). The SQUID Handbook. Wiley-VCH
- Tinkham, M. (2004). Introduction to Superconductivity. Dover Publications
```

## Review Categories

### Technical Content
- **Theoretical Framework**: Physics concepts, mathematical rigor
- **Physical Concepts**: Proper treatment of superconductivity, quantum mechanics
- **Technical Notation**: Units, symbols, mathematical expressions
- **Experimental Methods**: Methodology appropriateness and description

### Academic Writing
- **Academic Tone**: Appropriate scientific language and objectivity
- **Paragraph Structure**: Development of ideas and logical organization
- **Logical Flow**: Use of transitions and coherent argument development
- **Citation Standards**: Proper referencing and literature integration
