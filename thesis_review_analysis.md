### Chapter 1: 介紹
**Overall Assessment**: This chapter shows excellent development of 介紹 content with approximately 71 words. The technical treatment is appropriate for a master's level thesis, though some areas require attention to meet publication standards.

**Strengths**:
- Excellent bilingual presentation enhancing international accessibility
- Appropriate use of mathematical notation and equations
- Well-structured chapter organization with clear subsections

**Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Theoretical Framework**
   - Issue: Current-phase relation discussion lacks mathematical formulation
   - Suggestion: Include explicit mathematical expressions for CPR, starting with the basic sinusoidal form I_s = I_c sin(φ) and then discussing deviations for topological materials
   - Priority: High
   - Example: Consider adding: 'For conventional Josephson junctions, the CPR follows I_s(φ) = I_c sin(φ), however in topological materials like PtTe₂...'

2. **Paragraph Structure**
   - Issue: Many paragraphs are too short for academic writing
   - Suggestion: Develop ideas more fully within paragraphs. Each paragraph should contain 3-5 sentences that develop a single main idea with supporting details
   - Priority: Medium
