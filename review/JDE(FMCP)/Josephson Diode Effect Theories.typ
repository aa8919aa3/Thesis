  The Josephson Diode Effect (JDE), characterized by nonreciprocal critical supercurrents ($I_(c+) != |I_(c-)|$), has rapidly emerged as a pivotal phenomenon in superconducting electronics and quantum physics. This nonreciprocity is fundamentally rooted in the concurrent breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries within a Josephson junction. This review systematically dissects the primary theoretical frameworks that explain the JDE, focusing on two interconnected concepts: the macroscopic picture of Finite Momentum Cooper Pairing (FMCP) and the microscopic mechanism of Rashba-like Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC). It is shown that SOC, in conjunction with an external Zeeman field, acts as a primary driver for inducing a finite Cooper pair momentum, thereby providing a unified understanding of the effect. The key mathematical formalisms are presented, including the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations which reveal the origin of nonreciprocity in the asymmetric energy spectrum of Andreev bound states, and Ginzburg-Landau theory which describes the resulting helical superconducting state. The review critically analyzes key experimental signatures that validate these theories, such as the appearance of anomalous Fraunhofer patterns and the direct measurement of asymmetric Current-Phase Relations (CPRs). A comparative analysis of different JDE mechanisms—including those arising from extrinsic geometric asymmetries in multi-terminal junctions and the nuanced role of topology in systems hosting Majorana bound states—is provided. The report concludes by outlining the key open questions and future directions for the field, highlighting the search for field-free diode effects and the potential of JDE as a probe for exotic superconducting phases.

== Introduction: From Reciprocal to Nonreciprocal Supercurrents

The Josephson effect, a cornerstone of macroscopic quantum phenomena, describes the flow of a dissipationless supercurrent between two weakly coupled superconductors. For decades, this effect was understood as an intrinsically reciprocal process. However, recent theoretical and experimental advances have unveiled a nonreciprocal counterpart: the Josephson Diode Effect (JDE), where the magnitude of the critical supercurrent depends on its direction of flow. This discovery has not only opened new avenues for dissipationless electronics but has also provided a powerful tool for probing fundamental symmetries in unconventional superconducting systems. This review provides a comprehensive technical overview of the theoretical models developed to explain the JDE, bridging the gap from foundational concepts to the frontiers of current research.

=== The Conventional Josephson Effect: Symmetries of the Current-Phase Relation

The behavior of a Josephson junction (JJ) is fundamentally described by the relationship between the supercurrent $I$ flowing through it and the gauge-invariant phase difference $phi$ across the superconducting leads. For a canonical superconductor-insulator-superconductor (S-I-S) tunnel junction, the first Josephson relation gives a simple sinusoidal current-phase relation (CPR):
$ I(phi) = I_c sin(phi) $
where $I_c$ is the maximum supercurrent, or critical current, the junction can sustain.

Microscopically, the supercurrent in junctions with a normal metal or semiconductor weak link (S-N-S) is carried by Andreev Bound States (ABS) formed within the link. These discrete in-gap states arise from the coherent reflection of electrons and holes at the superconductor-normal interfaces. The energy of these states, $E_text("ABS")$, is dependent on the phase difference $phi$, and the supercurrent can be derived directly from this energy spectrum:
$ I(phi) = (2e)/planck.reduce sum_n (diff E_("ABS",n)(phi))/(diff phi) $
where the sum is over all occupied "ABS". In a conventional, symmetric junction, the "ABS" spectrum is an even function of the phase, $E_text("ABS")(phi) = E_text("ABS")(-phi)$. Consequently, the CPR is an odd function, satisfying the current-reversal symmetry $I(phi) = -I(-phi)$. This symmetry dictates that the maximum positive current ($I_(c+)$) and the magnitude of the maximum negative current ($|I_(c-)|$) are identical, leading to a reciprocal critical current, $I_(c+) = |I_(c-)|$. This reciprocity is a direct consequence of the underlying time-reversal and inversion symmetries of the system.

=== The Josephson Diode Effect: Definition and Figures of Merit

The Josephson Diode Effect (JDE) describes the breakdown of this reciprocity, manifesting as an inequality between the forward and reverse critical currents: $I_(c+) != |I_(c-)|$. This nonreciprocal behavior is the superconducting analogue of a conventional semiconductor diode. When a bias current $I_text("bias")$ is applied such that $min(I_c^+, |I_c^-|) < |I_text("bias")| < max(I_c^+, |I_c^-|)$, the junction enters a zero-voltage superconducting state for current flow in one direction but transitions to a finite-voltage resistive state in the opposite direction. This enables functionalities such as half-wave rectification of an applied AC supercurrent.

To quantify the degree of nonreciprocity, the diode efficiency $eta$ is defined as:
$ eta = (I_(c+) - |I_(c-)|) / (I_(c+) + |I_(c-)|) $
This dimensionless parameter ranges from $eta=0$ for a perfectly reciprocal junction to $eta=plus.minus 1$ for an ideal diode that supports supercurrent in only one direction. The JDE has been observed in a wide variety of physical systems, including planar S-N-S junctions based on semiconductor two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs), topological insulators, and multi-terminal device geometries, as illustrated in Figure 1.

=== Fundamental Symmetry Constraints for Nonreciprocity

The emergence of the JDE is deeply rooted in fundamental symmetry principles. It is now well-established that a necessary condition for an intrinsic JDE is the simultaneous breaking of both time-reversal symmetry ($cal(T)$) and inversion symmetry ($cal(I)$).

- #strong[Time-reversal symmetry ($cal(T)$)] ensures that the physics of a system is invariant under the reversal of time's arrow. In the context of transport, this implies that the properties of charge carriers with momentum $vec(k)$ are identical to those with $-vec(k)$. This symmetry is typically broken by an external magnetic field, which introduces a Zeeman energy term, or by the presence of intrinsic magnetism in the junction material.

- #strong[Inversion symmetry ($cal(I)$)], also known as parity symmetry ($cal(P)$), dictates that the system is invariant under spatial inversion ($vec(r) -> -vec(r)$). The breaking of this symmetry can be intrinsic to the crystal structure of the weak-link material (i.e., a non-centrosymmetric crystal) or can be induced by structural asymmetry, such as an electric field at an interface. The latter gives rise to Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), a key ingredient in many JDE platforms.

While breaking both $cal(T)$ and $cal(I)$ is necessary, it is not always sufficient. A more rigorous requirement is the breaking of all symmetries that enforce the current-reversion (JR) condition on the system's free energy, $F(B, phi) = F(B, -phi + theta)$, where $B$ is the magnetic field and $theta$ is a constant phase shift. Any symmetry operation (e.g., a combination of time-reversal and a spatial rotation) that leaves the free energy invariant under the transformation $phi -> -phi$ will enforce $I_(c+) = |I_(c-)|$, thus precluding a diode effect. Therefore, for a JDE to manifest, the system must be engineered such that no such JR-enforcing symmetries remain.

This symmetry analysis gives rise to a useful distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic JDE mechanisms. An intrinsic JDE originates from the microscopic properties of the weak-link material itself when subjected to symmetry-breaking fields (e.g., a material with strong SOC in a uniform magnetic field). In contrast, an extrinsic JDE arises from engineered asymmetries in the device architecture, such as a SQUID with unequal arms or a multi-terminal junction with an applied control current, which impose a non-uniform current or phase distribution. While intrinsic effects are often more desirable for scalable device applications, extrinsic mechanisms can offer greater in-situ tunability.

== The Macroscopic Picture: Finite Momentum Cooper Pairing (FMCP)

One of the primary theoretical frameworks for understanding the JDE is based on the concept of finite-momentum Cooper pairing (FMCP). In this picture, the nonreciprocal supercurrent is a direct consequence of Cooper pairs forming with a non-zero center-of-mass momentum, a state that fundamentally breaks the required symmetries.

=== Theoretical Foundations of the Helical Superconducting State

In conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, superconductivity arises from the pairing of electrons with opposite momenta and spins, ($vec(k) arrow.t$, $-vec(k) arrow.b$), resulting in Cooper pairs with zero net momentum. The possibility of pairing with a finite center-of-mass momentum, $vec(q) != 0$, was first proposed in the context of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The FFLO state can arise in clean superconductors under a strong magnetic field that is sufficient to significantly split the spin-up and spin-down Fermi surfaces, making it energetically favorable for electrons on these shifted surfaces to pair, thus imparting a finite momentum $vec(q)$ to the Cooper pair.

While the FFLO state requires extreme conditions (high magnetic fields and very low temperatures), a related but more accessible finite-momentum state, known as the helical superconducting state, is now understood to be central to the JDE. In this state, the superconducting order parameter acquires a spatially modulating phase but maintains a constant amplitude:
$ Delta(vec(r)) = Delta_0 e^(i vec(q) dot vec(r)) $
This state can emerge under much weaker conditions than the FFLO state, particularly in systems where inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, for instance, by the combination of SOC and a moderate Zeeman field. The presence of this spatially modulated phase is the macroscopic origin of the nonreciprocal transport properties.

=== Mathematical Formalism: Spatially Modulated Order Parameter and Doppler-Shifted Andreev Spectrum

The JDE can be derived analytically by considering a short, ballistic Josephson junction where the superconducting leads are described by a finite-momentum order parameter. The pair potentials in the left (L) and right (R) leads take the form:
$ Delta_(L,R)(vec(r)) = Delta_0 e^(i(phi_(L,R) + vec(q) dot vec(r))) $
The crucial physical consequence of the Cooper pair momentum $vec(q)$ is that it imparts a Doppler shift to the energy of quasiparticles traversing the junction. For a single-channel junction, the energies of the Andreev bound states, which carry the supercurrent, become asymmetric with respect to the direction of motion. The energy spectrum is modified from its conventional form to:
$ E_("ABS")(phi) approx plus.minus Delta sqrt(1 - tau sin^2(phi/2)) + planck.reduce vec(v)_F dot vec(q) $
where $tau$ is the channel transmission and $vec(v)_F$ is the Fermi velocity. The term $planck.reduce vec(v)_F dot vec(q)$ explicitly breaks the symmetry between forward- and backward-propagating quasiparticles, leading to an asymmetric ABS spectrum, $E_("ABS")(phi) != E_("ABS")(-phi)$.

This asymmetry in the energy spectrum translates directly into an asymmetric CPR. The total current through the junction is the sum of contributions from the discrete bound states and the continuum of quasiparticle states. In the presence of finite momentum pairing, the continuum contributes a phase-independent offset current. For a perfectly transparent short junction, the total current is given by:
$ I(phi) = (e Delta)/planck.reduce sin((tilde(phi))/2) sin(Delta cos((tilde(phi))/2) - q v_F) + (2 e q v_F)/(pi planck.reduce) $
where $tilde(phi) = phi + 2q d$ accounts for the phase accumulated by the Cooper pair traversing the junction of length $d$. This expression for the CPR is manifestly asymmetric. Both the argument of the sign function, which determines the phase at which the system transitions between ABS branches, and the constant current offset from the continuum explicitly break the current-reversal symmetry $I(phi) = -I(-phi)$. The critical currents $I_(c+)$ and $I_(c-)$ are found by maximizing and minimizing this expression with respect to $phi$, yielding unequal magnitudes that depend directly on the Cooper pair momentum $q$.

=== Experimental Validation: Anomalous Fraunhofer Patterns as a Signature of FMCP

The primary experimental tool for detecting and quantifying finite Cooper pair momentum in a Josephson junction is Fraunhofer magnetometry. In a conventional wide junction, applying a magnetic field $B_z$ perpendicular to the junction plane induces a phase gradient, leading to a Fraunhofer interference pattern for the critical current: $I_c(B_z) prop |sin(pi Phi/Phi_0)/(pi Phi/Phi_0)|$, where $Phi = B_z L W$ is the magnetic flux through the junction area and $Phi_0$ is the magnetic flux quantum. This pattern is symmetric about $B_z=0$ and has its maximum intensity in the central lobe.

In a system with FMCP, an in-plane magnetic field (e.g., $B_y$, parallel to the current) can induce a finite Cooper pair momentum $q$. This leads to a spatially oscillating supercurrent density along the junction width, $j_s(x) prop sin(phi_0 + q x)$. The resulting interference pattern is the Fourier transform of this modulated current density, which deviates significantly from the standard Fraunhofer pattern. This "anomalous" Fraunhofer pattern exhibits two key signatures of FMCP:
- A shift of the central lobe's maximum away from $B_z=0$.
- A transfer of the maximum critical current (spectral weight) from the central lobe to the side lobes as the in-plane field is increased.

These features provide a direct and quantitative measure of the induced Cooper pair momentum $q$. Seminal experiments on Josephson junctions fabricated on topological insulators like $"Bi"_2"Se"_3$ and topological semimetals like $"NiTe"_2$ have shown precisely this behavior. The clear observation of anomalous Fraunhofer patterns that evolve with an in-plane magnetic field, in conjunction with a strong JDE, provides compelling experimental validation for the finite-momentum Cooper pairing model.

== The Microscopic Driver: Rashba-like Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC)

While FMCP provides a powerful macroscopic description of the JDE, the microscopic origin of this finite momentum in many solid-state systems is Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC). SOC, a relativistic effect, couples an electron's spin to its momentum, providing the essential mechanism for breaking inversion symmetry and enabling the nonreciprocal phenomena observed in Josephson diodes.

=== SOC-Induced Band Splitting and Spin-Momentum Locking

In low-dimensional systems lacking structural inversion symmetry, such as at the interface of a heterostructure, electrons experience an effective electric field perpendicular to the plane. This field gives rise to Rashba SOC, which is described by the Hamiltonian:
$ H_R = alpha_R (vec(sigma) times vec(k)) dot hat(z) = alpha_R (k_y sigma_x - k_x sigma_y) $
where $alpha_R$ is the Rashba coupling strength, $sigma$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and $vec(k)$ is the electron momentum. This interaction acts as a momentum-dependent effective magnetic field in the plane of the 2D system. Its primary effect is to lift the spin degeneracy of the electronic bands. A simple parabolic band $E(k) = planck.reduce^2 k^2 / (2m^*)$ splits into two spin-chiral parabolic sub-bands with energies:
$ E_p m(k) = (planck.reduce^2 k^2)/(2m^*) plus.minus alpha_R |k| $
The resulting Fermi surface consists of two concentric circles with opposite spin helicities, a phenomenon known as spin-momentum locking. This band structure is the fundamental starting point for understanding the JDE in many semiconductor and topological material-based junctions.

    (a) In the presence of Rashba SOC alone, the spin degeneracy is lifted, creating two spin-split parabolic bands with opposite helicity. The Fermi surface consists of two concentric circles. 
    (b) The application of an in-plane Zeeman field (e.g., $B_x$) breaks time-reversal symmetry and shifts the two parabolas in opposite directions along the $k_y$ axis. This results in an asymmetric energy dispersion, $E(vec(k)) != E(-vec(k))$, which is the microscopic origin of the asymmetric Andreev spectrum and the JDE.
  ]
) <fig:bands>

=== Interplay with Zeeman Fields: Generating Asymmetry in the Andreev Spectrum

While Rashba SOC breaks inversion symmetry, time-reversal symmetry is still preserved, and the band structure remains symmetric upon inversion of momentum, $E(vec(k)) = E(-vec(k))$. To induce nonreciprocity, time-reversal symmetry must also be broken. This is typically achieved by applying an in-plane magnetic field, which introduces a Zeeman term, $H_Z = g mu_B vec(B) dot vec(sigma)$.

The combination of Rashba SOC and a Zeeman field creates a profoundly asymmetric electronic structure. As shown in Figure 2b, an in-plane magnetic field shifts the two spin-split parabolas relative to each other in momentum space. The resulting energy dispersion is no longer symmetric with respect to momentum inversion, $E(vec(k)) != E(-vec(k))$. This asymmetry in the normal state band structure is the microscopic root of the JDE. When this normal region is placed between two superconductors, the Andreev reflection processes at the interfaces become inherently asymmetric. This, in turn, leads to an asymmetric spectrum of Andreev bound states, where $E_("ABS")(phi) != E_("ABS")(-phi)$.

=== From Asymmetric Spectrum to Nonreciprocal CPR and the $phi_0$-Junction

The asymmetry of the ABS spectrum, derived from the interplay of SOC and the Zeeman effect, directly imprints itself onto the current-phase relation of the junction. Since $I(phi)$ is proportional to the derivative of the ABS energies with respect to $phi$, an asymmetric spectrum necessarily yields an asymmetric CPR that no longer satisfies $I(phi) = -I(-phi)$.

Such a CPR can be generally described by a Fourier series containing both sine and cosine terms (or equivalently, phase-shifted sine terms):
$ I(phi) = sum_n [I_(s,n) sin(n phi) + I_(c,n) cos(n phi)] $
The presence of the cosine terms, $I_(c,n) != 0$, is a direct signature of broken current-reversal symmetry. This leads to two related phenomena. First is the anomalous Josephson effect, also known as the $phi_0$-junction, where the CPR is shifted along the phase axis. This results in a finite supercurrent at zero phase difference, $I(phi=0) != 0$, and a ground state (zero current) at a finite phase offset, $I(phi_0) = 0$. Second, and more central to this review, is the JDE. When the CPR is skewed or phase-shifted in this manner, its positive maximum ($I_(c+)$) and negative minimum ($I_(c-)$) are generally not equal in magnitude, giving rise to a nonreciprocal critical current. The $phi_0$-junction can thus be seen as a precursor to the JDE, with both effects stemming from the same underlying symmetry breaking.

=== Quantitative Analysis of SOC-JDE: Dependence on Material Parameters and Field Orientation

The magnitude of the JDE is highly sensitive to both material parameters and the external field configuration. Theoretical models and experimental results have established several key dependencies:
- #strong[SOC Strength ($alpha_R$):] The diode efficiency $eta$ generally increases with the Rashba strength $alpha_R$, as SOC is the primary mechanism for inversion symmetry breaking. However, for very strong SOC, competing effects such as the relaxation of spin-triplet superconducting correlations can lead to a suppression of the diode effect. Consequently, an optimal, intermediate value of $alpha_R$ often maximizes the efficiency.
- #strong[Magnetic Field Orientation:] The JDE exhibits strong magnetochiral anisotropy. For a system dominated by Rashba SOC, the effect is maximized when the in-plane magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the direction of supercurrent flow ($vec(B) perp vec(I)$). The effect typically vanishes when the field is parallel to the current ($vec(B) parallel vec(I)$). This distinct angular dependence serves as a crucial experimental signature to identify the Rashba-SOC mechanism as the dominant contributor to the JDE.
- #strong[Material Parameters:] The diode effect is sensitive to the interplay between the characteristic energy scales of the system: the Rashba spin-orbit energy ($E_("SO") = m^2 alpha_R^2 / (2 planck.reduce^2)$), the Zeeman energy ($E_Z = g mu_B B$), and the proximity-induced superconducting gap ($Delta^*$). The JDE is typically most pronounced when these energy scales are comparable, $E_("SO") ~ E_Z ~ Delta^*$. Materials with a small effective mass $m^*$ and a large Landé g-factor $g^*$, such as InAs and InSb, are therefore ideal platforms for observing a strong JDE.

== Synthesis and Broader Theoretical Context

The theoretical pictures based on Finite Momentum Cooper Pairing and Spin-Orbit Coupling are not competing but are, in fact, two sides of the same coin. The microscopic SOC mechanism provides the physical origin for the macroscopic FMCP state. Understanding this connection, along with alternative pathways to nonreciprocity, places the JDE in a broader and more powerful context.

=== Unifying the Frameworks: How SOC Induces Finite Momentum Pairing

The synthesis of the macroscopic and microscopic viewpoints provides a complete physical picture of the intrinsic JDE. In a system with Rashba SOC, the two spin-split Fermi surfaces are concentric at zero magnetic field. The application of an in-plane Zeeman field breaks time-reversal symmetry and shifts these two Fermi surfaces in opposite directions in momentum space, as depicted in Figure 2b. For Cooper pairing to occur, electrons from states ($vec(k)$, $sigma$) and ($-vec(k)$, $-sigma'$) must form a bound state. Due to the momentum-space shift of the Fermi surfaces, pairing between states of opposite momentum is no longer optimal. Instead, it becomes energetically favorable for electrons to form pairs with a finite center-of-mass momentum $vec(q)$ that bridges the momentum offset between the spin-split bands. Typically, intra-band pairing on the larger of the two Fermi surfaces dominates, directly giving rise to a helical superconducting state with a well-defined Cooper pair momentum $vec(q)$.

This establishes a clear causal chain:
1. Rashba SOC breaks inversion symmetry, creating spin-split bands.
2. A Zeeman field breaks time-reversal symmetry, shifting these bands in momentum space.
3. This shift makes finite-momentum Cooper pairing energetically favorable, leading to a helical superconducting state with momentum $vec(q)$.
4. The finite momentum $vec(q)$ causes a Doppler shift in the Andreev spectrum, resulting in a nonreciprocal CPR and the Josephson diode effect.

This unified framework elevates the significance of the JDE. While direct experimental measurement of the spatially modulating phase of a helical superconductor is exceptionally challenging, requiring complex interferometry, the JDE provides a direct and accessible transport signature of this exotic superconducting state. The observation of a nonreciprocal critical current is, therefore, not merely a device characteristic but a powerful probe for discovering and characterizing unconventional finite-momentum superconductivity.

=== Alternative and Complementary Mechanisms

While the intrinsic SOC-driven FMCP mechanism is a primary focus of research, several other physical mechanisms can produce a JDE, often relying on extrinsic or geometric asymmetries.

- #strong[Asymmetric SQUIDs:] A robust JDE can be realized in a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) loop comprising two junctions with different CPRs. If at least one junction has a non-sinusoidal CPR (i.e., contains higher harmonics), and a magnetic flux threads the loop (breaking $cal(T)$), the interference between the two CPRs becomes asymmetric with respect to the direction of current flow, leading to $I_(c+) != |I_(c-)|$. This mechanism is highly tunable via the external flux.
- #strong[Multi-terminal Junctions:] Devices with three or more superconducting terminals offer additional degrees of freedom for controlling nonreciprocity. By manipulating the multiple phase differences via local magnetic fluxes or by applying a dissipationless control current to one terminal, one can modulate the critical current between two other terminals in a nonreciprocal manner.
- #strong[Vortex Dynamics:] In wide junctions or thin films where Josephson vortices can form, nonreciprocity can arise from asymmetric vortex dynamics. By engineering geometric asymmetries, such as sawtooth-like edges or strategically placed defects, one can create an asymmetric pinning potential (a "vortex ratchet"). This makes it easier for vortices to enter or exit the junction from one side than the other, leading to a direction-dependent critical current, which is determined by the vortex depinning current.

=== The Role of Topology: JDE in Proximity to Majorana Bound States

The material platforms that are ideal for realizing the JDE—namely, semiconductor nanowires or topological insulators with strong SOC, proximity-coupled to a superconductor and subjected to a magnetic field—are the very same systems at the forefront of the search for topological superconductivity and Majorana Bound States (MBS). This overlap raises profound questions about the interplay between nonreciprocal transport and topology.

The emergence of MBS at the ends of a topological Josephson junction fundamentally alters the ABS spectrum, introducing protected zero-energy crossings and a 4$pi$-periodic component to the CPR. This modification of the underlying spectrum inevitably impacts the JDE. However, the relationship is nuanced. Theoretical studies indicate that while the JDE can be significantly enhanced near a topological phase transition, the presence of MBS is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a large diode effect. The diode efficiency depends on the complex interplay of all Andreev levels, not just the topological zero modes.

Despite this complexity, the JDE may serve as a valuable experimental indicator for topological phase transitions. The evolution of the diode efficiency $eta$ as a function of the Zeeman field, $eta(B)$, is predicted to exhibit distinct features, such as kinks or sharp oscillatory patterns, that correlate with the closing and reopening of the topological gap. Therefore, while not a direct probe of MBS, precision measurements of the JDE can provide complementary evidence for the onset of a topological phase in these hybrid systems.

== Comparative Analysis and Future Outlook

The theoretical landscape of the Josephson diode effect is rich and diverse, with multiple mechanisms contributing to nonreciprocal supercurrents in different physical regimes. A critical comparison of these models is essential for guiding future research and interpreting experimental results.

=== Critical Evaluation of Competing Theoretical Models

The various theoretical approaches to the JDE can be categorized based on their underlying physical mechanism, material requirements, and key experimental signatures. Table 1 provides a comparative summary of the most prominent models. This taxonomy helps to clarify the conditions under which each model is applicable and provides a framework for designing experiments to distinguish between competing physical origins of nonreciprocity.

=== Open Questions and Theoretical Frontiers

Despite rapid progress, several fundamental questions and theoretical challenges remain at the forefront of JDE research.

- #strong[Field-Free JDE:] A major goal is the realization of a strong, tunable JDE without an external magnetic field, which is detrimental to many superconducting applications. This requires materials with intrinsic time-reversal symmetry breaking. Promising directions include junctions with barriers made of altermagnets—a class of magnets with spin-split bands but zero net magnetization—or materials predicted to host exotic loop-current phases.
- #strong[Quantitative Discrepancies:] There is often a significant gap between the high diode efficiencies predicted by idealized theoretical models and those measured in experiments. Bridging this gap requires more sophisticated models that incorporate the effects of material disorder, multi-channel transport in wide junctions, and non-equilibrium effects like quasiparticle poisoning.
- #strong[Disentangling Mechanisms:] In many experimental systems, multiple mechanisms for nonreciprocity may coexist. For example, in a wide junction made from a strong SOC material, both the intrinsic FMCP effect and extrinsic vortex-based effects could contribute. Developing experimental protocols to unambiguously disentangle these different contributions is a critical challenge.
- #strong[JDE and Topology:] The precise, quantitative link between the JDE and topological superconductivity remains an open question. While correlations have been predicted, it is unclear if the JDE can be developed into a definitive, quantitative probe for topological invariants or the presence of MBS.

=== Prospects for Material Realization and Device Application

The field of Josephson diodes is continuously enriched by the exploration of new material platforms. Beyond the well-studied InAs and InSb 2DEGs, significant potential lies in junctions based on topological materials (topological insulators, Dirac/Weyl semimetals), which naturally host spin-momentum-locked surface states ideal for generating FMCP. Furthermore, twisted 2D materials, such as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, have emerged as highly tunable platforms where correlated states can spontaneously break the necessary symmetries for a JDE, even at zero magnetic field.

The prospect of a highly efficient, tunable, and field-free Josephson diode is a powerful driver for innovation in superconducting electronics. Potential applications are vast, ranging from on-chip rectifiers and current switches for cryogenic computing to nonreciprocal circuit elements like gyrators and isolators, which are essential for routing and protecting delicate quantum information in superconducting quantum processors. As theoretical understanding deepens and material fabrication techniques advance, the Josephson diode is poised to transition from a scientific curiosity to an indispensable component in the future of superconducting technology.
