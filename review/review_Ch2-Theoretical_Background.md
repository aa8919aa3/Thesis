### Chapter 2: 理論背景
**Overall Assessment**: This chapter shows good development of 理論背景 content with approximately 2007 words. The technical treatment is appropriate for a master's level thesis, though some areas require attention to meet publication standards.

**Strengths**:
- Excellent bilingual presentation enhancing international accessibility
- Strong technical vocabulary and physics terminology usage
- Appropriate use of mathematical notation and equations
- Well-structured chapter organization with clear subsections
- Includes references to existing literature

**Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Physical Concepts**
   - Issue: Discussion of Cooper pairs without mentioning coherence length
   - Suggestion: When discussing Cooper pairs, include the relevant length scales, particularly the superconducting coherence length ξ ≈ 200 nm for PtTe₂
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Academic Writing**
   - Issue: Inconsistent figure referencing format
   - Suggestion: Use consistent figure referencing throughout. In Typst, use @fig:label format for automatic numbering and cross-referencing
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Academic Tone**
   - Issue: Excessive use of first-person pronouns
   - Suggestion: Consider using more passive voice and objective language typical of scientific writing. Replace 'we measured' with 'measurements were performed' or 'the results show'
   - Priority: Medium

4. **Paragraph Structure**
   - Issue: Many paragraphs are too short for academic writing
   - Suggestion: Develop ideas more fully within paragraphs. Each paragraph should contain 3-5 sentences that develop a single main idea with supporting details
   - Priority: Medium

5. **Logical Flow**
   - Issue: Limited use of transition words between ideas
   - Suggestion: Improve logical flow by adding appropriate transition words and phrases to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs
   - Priority: Low

**Specific Line-by-Line Comments**:
- Line 11: Consider breaking this long sentence into smaller parts for clarity
- Line 19: Consider breaking this long sentence into smaller parts for clarity
- Line 19: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
- Line 21: Consider breaking this long sentence into smaller parts for clarity
- Line 21: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
- Line 23: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
- Line 25: Consider breaking this long sentence into smaller parts for clarity
- Line 25: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
- Line 29: Consider breaking this long sentence into smaller parts for clarity
- Line 29: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
