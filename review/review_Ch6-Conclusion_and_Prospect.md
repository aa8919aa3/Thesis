### Chapter 6: 結論與展望
**Overall Assessment**: This chapter shows excellent development of 結論與展望 content with approximately 307 words. The technical treatment is appropriate for a master's level thesis, though some areas require attention to meet publication standards.

**Strengths**:
- Excellent bilingual presentation enhancing international accessibility
- Strong technical vocabulary and physics terminology usage
- Appropriate use of mathematical notation and equations
- Well-structured chapter organization with clear subsections

**Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Paragraph Structure**
   - Issue: Many paragraphs are too short for academic writing
   - Suggestion: Develop ideas more fully within paragraphs. Each paragraph should contain 3-5 sentences that develop a single main idea with supporting details
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Logical Flow**
   - Issue: Limited use of transition words between ideas
   - Suggestion: Improve logical flow by adding appropriate transition words and phrases to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs
   - Priority: Low

**Specific Line-by-Line Comments**:
- Line 8: Consider breaking this long sentence into smaller parts for clarity
- Line 15: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
- Line 18: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
- Line 24: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
- Line 48: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
- Line 78: Ensure proper spacing around mathematical expressions
