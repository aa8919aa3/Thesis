### Chapter 2: ch2-2-Device Fabrication
**Overall Assessment**: This chapter shows good development of ch2-2-device fabrication content with approximately 563 words. The technical treatment is appropriate for a master's level thesis, though some areas require attention to meet publication standards.

**Strengths**:
- Excellent bilingual presentation enhancing international accessibility
- Well-structured chapter organization with clear subsections

**Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Paragraph Structure**
   - Issue: Many paragraphs are too short for academic writing
   - Suggestion: Develop ideas more fully within paragraphs. Each paragraph should contain 3-5 sentences that develop a single main idea with supporting details
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Logical Flow**
   - Issue: Limited use of transition words between ideas
   - Suggestion: Improve logical flow by adding appropriate transition words and phrases to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs
   - Priority: Low

**Specific Line-by-Line Comments**:
- Line 33: Check for repeated articles ('the the' or 'a a')
- Line 68: Consider breaking this long sentence into smaller parts for clarity
- Line 79: Consider breaking this long sentence into smaller parts for clarity
- Line 102: Consider breaking this long sentence into smaller parts for clarity

**Recommended Resources**:
- Alley, M. (2018). The Craft of Scientific Writing. Springer - for improving academic writing style
